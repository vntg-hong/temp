# Alembic Versions Directory

This directory contains all database migration files generated by Alembic.

## File Naming Convention

Migration files are automatically named with timestamps:
```
YYYYMMDD_HHMM_description.py
```

Example:
```
20260126_1430_create_user_table.py
20260126_1445_add_email_to_user.py
```

## DO NOT

- ❌ Manually edit existing migration files (except for fixing bugs)
- ❌ Delete migration files that have been applied to production
- ❌ Change the order of migrations

## Guidelines

- ✅ Always use `alembic revision --autogenerate` to create new migrations
- ✅ Review generated migrations before applying
- ✅ Test migrations in development before deploying to production
- ✅ Keep migrations small and focused on a single change
- ✅ Write descriptive migration messages
